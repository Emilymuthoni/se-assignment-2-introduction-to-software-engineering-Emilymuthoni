 Process of requirement engineering
 Elicitation- involves gathering requirements from stakeholders using techniques such as interviews, questionnaires, brainstorming sessions, and observation are used to extract requirements.
Analysis- Collected requirements are analyzed for feasibility, consistency, completeness, and relevance
Specification: The requirements are documented in a formal and structured manner, usually in a requirements document or specification.
Validation: The documented requirements are reviewed and validated by stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs and expectations.
Management: Requirements management involves tracking changes, maintaining version control, and ensuring that all stakeholders are informed of modifications.



Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity  is the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, independent modules or components, each responsible for a specific function or feature

Testing in Software Engineering:
It is a process that involves systematically examining and validating various aspects of the software to ensure it meets specified requirements and quality standards


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing-Involves testing individual units or components of the software to verify that each unit behaves as expected and meets its design specifications. Automated testing frameworks are often used to execute unit tests efficiently.
Integration testing- Involves testing the interactions and interfaces between different units or modules to verify that they work together correctly to  ensure that the integrated components function as a cohesive system and can detect issues such as communication errors or data mismatches.
System testing-  Involves testing the entire software system as a whole to validate its behavior and functionality against specified requirements.
Acceptance testing: Involves testing the software from the perspective of end-users or stakeholders to determine whether it meets their needs and expectations.
Regression testing:Involves testing the software after making changes or updates to ensure that existing functionality has not been adversely affected.
Performance testing: Involves testing the performance characteristics of the software, such as its responsiveness, scalability, and resource usage, under various conditions.
Security testing: Involves testing the software for vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and security flaws  that help identify and mitigate security risks, protect sensitive data, and ensure compliance with security standards and regulations.





Version Control Systems:
Version control systems are software tools that enable developers to manage changes to source code, documents, and other files in a collaborative environment. They provide mechanisms for tracking revisions, managing branches, merging changes, and coordinating work among multiple contributors.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Importance of Version Controls systems
History and Audit Trail- Maintain a complete history of changes made to files, including who made the changes, when they were made, and what changes were made.
Collaboration- Fosters collaboration among developers by providing a centralized repository where team members can share and synchronize their work.
Risk Management:Mitigate the risk of data loss or corruption by storing files in a secure, redundant repository.
Quality Assurance-support best practices such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration, which contribute to the overall quality and reliability of the software. 
Traceability and Documentation- Version control systems enhance traceability by linking changes to specific issues, tasks, or requirements in project management tools.
